# Hardcore Stat Tracker

<img src="HardcoreStatTracker.png" alt="Hardcore Stat Tracker logo" width="160" align="right">

**A trophy case for your hardcore character.** Hardcore Stat Tracker quietly records your closest calls, biggest hits, toughest kills, and the rest of your run's defining moments, and shows them in a compact on-screen panel and a detailed full window. Built for **WoW Classic Era / Hardcore (1.15.x)**.

## Features

- **Survival records** — Closest Call (lowest HP% + the raw number), Nearest Death (how many seconds from dying you were, based on incoming DPS), Biggest Hit Taken, Highest Fall (as a share of your max HP at impact — a number that actually means something across levels), Clutch Saves, Untouched Streak, Most Foes at Once, Panic Moments, Fights Survived, Total Damage Taken.
- **Combat records** — Highest Crit, Biggest Melee / Ranged / Spell Hit, Killing Blows, Longest Fight, Most Damage Taken in One Fight, Toughest Foe (highest level above you that you took on).
- **Healing records** — Biggest Heal, Total Healing (effective, overheal excluded), and Players Saved (a direct heal that pulled a critically-low party member back from the brink).
- **Pet & group** — current pet, pet deaths (with a log), Pet Killing Blows (tracked separately for pet-only challenges), party-member deaths you witnessed, and buffs you've put on other players.
- **Wealth** — Gold Earned (lifetime income — loot, quests, vendoring) and Gold Looted (coin straight off kills and loot).
- **Adventure** — quests completed, zones explored, and Time Alive (your `/played`, which for a hardcore character *is* your time alive).
- **Mak'gora (account-wide)** — duels won and lost, persisting across all your characters.
- **Mob tooltips (account-wide)** — hover a mob and see "Has hit you for up to X (at lvl Y)" if it's hurt any of your characters before. Your new character inherits the warnings.
- **Records integrity (anti-fake)** — the full window shows how many times this character's records have been reset, and runs an integrity check on the saved file. If the `SavedVariables` were hand-edited outside the game, the character is flagged. *(This catches casual file edits — it is a deterrent, not unbreakable tamper-proofing.)*
- **Comic splashes** — optional fun: a comic-book **POW! / BOOM! / ZAP!** pops on screen when you set a new record (crit / melee / ranged by default). Each of the six slots can be turned off, dragged anywhere, linked to any record stat, and given its own sound.
- **Famous Last Words** — optional: when you drop low, broadcast a cocky/ironic line to chat (built-in surprise pool + your own messages) and/or fire an attention alert (screen flash + sound). Independent thresholds for the chat line and the alert.
- **Record announcements** — optional, two separate streams: new personal bests go to **party / say** a few seconds after a fight you survive (never raid, with a per-fight cap so it stays rare); and an opt-in **guild** line only for genuine clutch survivals (dropping to ≤5% HP and living), rate-limited and never fired from the grave.
- **Two views** — a customizable mini panel (pick exactly which stats show; pets default to pet classes only) and a designed two-column full window with icons, a color-coded danger bar, per-stat explanation tooltips, "new!" highlights on fresh records, and Escape-to-close. Anything you enable on the mini panel also shows in the full window — even in sections it would otherwise hide for your class.
- **Quick Settings** — the full window's **Display** button opens a popup with live scale and background-opacity sliders for both the mini panel and the full window.
- **Adjustable** — text size, panel scale, background opacity, draggable frames, full per-stat visibility control.

## Installation

1. Download and unzip into `World of Warcraft/_classic_era_/Interface/AddOns/`.
2. Make sure the folder is named `HardcoreStatTracker` and contains the `.toc`.
3. `/reload` or restart the game.

## Usage

- The mini panel appears on screen — drag it anywhere.
- Click the `[+]` button (or `/hst full`) for the full window with every stat and its context.
- `/hst` opens settings; `/hst config` jumps straight there.

## Slash commands

- `/hst` — toggle the mini panel
- `/hst full` — open the full window
- `/hst config` — open settings
- `/hst splashes` — enter placement mode to drag the comic splashes
- `/hst welcome` — show the welcome window again
- `/hst reset` — clear this character's records (account-wide Mak'gora is kept)
- `/hst makgora won|lost` — manually record a Mak'gora result
- `/hst makgora debug` — print the raw Mak'gora system message (to refine auto-detection)

`/hcstats` and `/hc` still work as aliases for `/hst`.

## Notes

- Stats are **per-character** (each new hardcore character starts fresh) except **Mak'gora**, which is account-wide.
- Text matching for Famous Last Words and a few records is tuned for an **English (enUS)** client.
- Auto chat to `/say` uses the next keypress (a hardware-event requirement), so it fires the moment you press anything after dropping low.
